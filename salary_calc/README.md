## Description
The salary calculator is a **python** program to help determine weekly, biweekly, and annually pay for a job. With this caluclator, you will no longer need to calculate the salary using your phone calulcator when job descriptions only list the hourly pay. Just input the necessary information and let the program run its course.

## Features
- User input
- Hourly > Weekly > Bi-Weekly > Annual Salary conversion
- Human readable format

## Why?
I made this program because I got tired of manually calculating salaries for jobs I was searching for. Despite most job descriptions listing the salary, some listed hourly pay. This forced me to multiply that by forty hour work weeks and fifty-two weeks in the year... and bam I got quickly annoyed. By writing this program, it allowed me to **automate** the process while also giving it a somewhat "human" feeling in the prompt.

## Future updates
- Calculate federal and state taxes to determine a more accurate salary.
- Convert to .exe file
